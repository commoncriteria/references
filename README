The Makefile expects the freely-available Saxon XSLT
processor to be installed.  It is available from:
	 http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/

The Makefile expects a new "saxon" directory to be created 
in the home directory and for the saxon9he.jar file to be in it.




Here are some utility scripts, to verify correspondence:

Getting the CCIs in the CCI list:
$ grep "CCI-" U_CCI_List.xml | cut -c 17-26 | sort -n

Getting the CCIs from the comparison document (which are only for rev 4):
$ grep "\(CCI-"  output/nistvscci.html | cut -c 29-38 | sort -n
